Web Application Penetration Testing (WAPT) is a systematic process used to identify, exploit, and remediate vulnerabilities in web applications. The goal is to mimic a malicious attacker and discover weaknesses in the application's design, configuration, or implementation that could be exploited to gain unauthorized access, steal data, or disrupt services.

Key Phases of Web Application Penetration Testing
Planning and Reconnaissance

Information Gathering: Collect data about the target web application, including URLs, technologies used (e.g., web servers, databases, programming languages), and any third-party services.
Passive Reconnaissance: Collect publicly available data without interacting with the target (e.g., Google dorking, WHOIS lookups, social media, etc.).
Active Reconnaissance: Actively interact with the web application by mapping out its structure and identifying entry points like forms, cookies, headers, and APIs.
Vulnerability Identification (Scanning)

Automated Scanning: Use tools like OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, or Nmap to perform vulnerability scans. These tools help identify common security flaws such as:
SQL Injection
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
Manual Analysis: Reviewing the application manually to spot vulnerabilities that may not be detected by automated tools, such as business logic flaws or hidden functionality.
Exploitation

Active Exploitation: Attempting to exploit the identified vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access or cause damage. This step confirms whether the vulnerability is truly exploitable.
SQL Injection: Extracting data from the database.
XSS: Executing malicious scripts within a userâ€™s browser.
File Inclusion Attacks: Gaining control over the server by injecting or executing files.
Session Hijacking: Taking over user sessions through cookie manipulation.
Privilege Escalation: Testing whether an attacker can elevate their privileges within the system (e.g., from a user to admin).
Post-Exploitation
