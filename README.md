Web Application Penetration Testing python


How the Script Works:
SQL Injection:

This part of the script tries different SQL injection payloads in a parameterized URL.
It checks the response for SQL errors or other indicators of vulnerability.
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):

The script tests for XSS by injecting common XSS payloads into a URL parameter.
It checks if the payload is reflected in the response, indicating a vulnerability.
Insecure Authentication:

Basic checks for weak authentication by attempting to log in with common weak credentials.
This is a simple demonstration and should be enhanced with more sophisticated techniques in a real-world scenario.
